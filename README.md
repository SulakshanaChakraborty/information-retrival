This repository contains the code and report for information retrival and data mining tasks. The full report can be found [here](https://github.com/SulakshanaChakraborty/information-retrival/blob/main/report.pdf). 

## task 1
* Extracts terms for 1-gram models by performing basic preprocessing steps of text normalisation, tokenisation and lemmatisation. 
* Computes text statistic of the corpus and compares with Zipf's law. 

## task 2
Computes inverted index of the corpus.

## task 3
Retrival models are implemnted from scatrch which includes tf-idf and MB25

## task 4
three unigram query likelihood models were implemented using different smoothing techniques namely, Laplace, Lidstone and Dirichlet.
