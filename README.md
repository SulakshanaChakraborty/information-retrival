* task1.py : Extracts terms for 1-gram models by performing basic preprocessing steps of text normalisation, tokenisation and lemmatisation. 
* task2.py : Computes inverted index of the corpus.
* task3.py : Retrival models are implemnted from scatrch which includes Tf-Idf and BM25
* task4.py : Three unigram query likelihood models were implemented using different smoothing techniques namely, Laplace, Lidstone and Dirichlet.
